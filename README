# Tutorial For Using WC ntuples

Created for the September 2024 MicroBooNE Analysis Workshop at University of Minnesota

## Getting Started

In this tutorial, I will assume that you're working locally, rather than on the MicroBooNE GPVMs. I would recommend using VSCode or Cursor, but any jupyter notebook environment will work.

```
git clone https://github.com/leehagaman/wc_ntuple_tutorial.

# these steps are optional, you can skip them if you already have a python environment that includes or can install these packages.
# make sure that any conda environments you might have are deactivated, with conda deactivate
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install requirements.txt # or python -m pip install jupyter matplotlib numpy pandas uproot
```

If you're using VSCode or Cursor, open tutorial.ipynb, clicking "select environment" in the top right, clicking "python environments", and then clicking "venv", or another python environment if you'd like to use that.
